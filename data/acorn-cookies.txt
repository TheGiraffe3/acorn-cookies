			`You're ushered from the landing platform to a nearby hospital when Eeeya finally manages to convey your intent. A few Unfettered Hai nearby are muttering in their language, and you keep hearing the Hai word for "cookies" as they watch Eeeya. Along the way, you notice an odd contrast of squalor and advanced machinery. Unlike their southern brethren, it seems the Unfettered value function and progress over aesthetics and comfort like their southern brethren.`
			`	As you rise through the main tower of the hospital, you're surprised at how advanced it is. Despite their willingness to die in battle, the Unfettered seem to value the lives of the survivors. Perhaps this hospital is to heal them quickly to fight again.`
			`	You reach a high floor filled with personal offices. Eeeya knocks on each door, apologizing when the Unfettered inside aren't who she's looking for, until you finally reach the very last room.`
			`	Eeeya opens this door, and runs to the Hai inside it - Anoo. A few minutes later, they begin to speak. Eventually the conversation turns to Anoo's new occupation.`
			`	"Why did you come here, Anoo? The Unfettered hate us."`
			`	"They don't hate us in particular, grandma. They hate what we've become: frivolous, uninventive, and self-important. Our race is fading into history through a slow death of mediocrity. Most Unfettered see warfare as our only salvation.` # "us in particular" should be changed to "us" and italicized if/when support for that is ever implemented.
			`	"We think of them as mindless brutes, but they're not! They have scientists, doctors, musicians, and writers. Our resources dwarf theirs, but they thrive with what little they have. Soon the Unfettered will have many more planets and almost unlimited resources. The era of scarcity will be over, and they'll have the power to choose their future.`
			`	"If enough good people join the Unfettered, we can change their minds and set them on a more productive path. They'll need good doctors."`

			`	"I'm sorry, Anoo, but I really think Captain <first> is right. While the Unfettered may be kind enough to shelter Hai who come bereaved from their own shots, they do have much starvation. And also, I can't sell cookies here. I will come visit occasionally though.`
